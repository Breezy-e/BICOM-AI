# BICOM-AI
Your AI executive for strategy, market insights, and smart business decisions.
BICOM AI (Business & Commerce AI) is an intelligent decision-support platform designed to help businesses, startups, and organizations make smarter strategic decisions using data, analytics, and artificial intelligence.

The project focuses on transforming raw business data into clear insights that support leadership, planning, forecasting, and operational efficiency. BICOM AI aims to act as a virtual AI executive—analyzing trends, highlighting risks, identifying opportunities, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

This project is being developed as a long-term initiative with the goal of solving real-world business and economic challenges, particularly in emerging markets. It is also intended to demonstrate practical skills in software engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, and system design.
